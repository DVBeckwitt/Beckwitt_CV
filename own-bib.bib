  abstract = {The fabrication and characterization of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures composed of graphene and layered transition-metal oxides were investigated to elucidate their structural and optoelectronic properties for advanced material applications. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) was employed to synthesize the heterostructures, enabling precise control over composition and thickness. The resulting materials were systematically characterized using X-ray diffraction to assess crystallographic structure, Raman spectroscopy to probe vibrational modes and electronic interactions, and scanning electron microscopy to examine surface morphology and microstructural features. The study reveals critical insights into the interfacial phenomena and property enhancements arising from the integration of these materials, highlighting their potential for applications in next-generation electronic, photonic, and energy technologies.},

  abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) materials, comprised of vertically stacked two-dimensional (2D) molecular layers, exhibit strong in-plane bonds and weak out-of-plane interactions. These systems offer enhanced tunability and the potential for tailoring their electronic and magnetic properties, which are sensitive to their surface interactions. Consequently, it is important to characterize the stacking and orientational properties between the molecularly thin vdW layers. Using x-ray diffraction with an area detector, we explore vdW thin films of PbI$_2$ grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as well as perovskite films produced by intercalating PbI$_2$ films with long-chain organic cations. Owing to the weak vdW interaction with the substrate, the films grow flat on any substrate. Furthermore, rotational disorder is observed in the film plane, giving rise to a 2D powder. This 2D powder manifests as well-defined diffraction spots, which we have quantitatively modelled. The area detector lends well to the observation of stacking disorder, which is also a result of the weak vdW interaction between the layers. The interpretation and modeling of the diffraction images will be discussed and represents a broadly useful approach for investigating layered vdW systems that comprise a ubiquitous class of materials.},
