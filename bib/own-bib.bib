  title = {Fabrication and Characterization of 2D Heterostructure of Graphene and Transition Metal Oxides},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {The fabrication and characterization of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures composed of graphene and layered transition-metal oxides were investigated to elucidate their structural and optoelectronic properties for advanced material applications. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) was employed to synthesize the heterostructures, enabling precise control over composition and thickness. The resulting materials were systematically characterized using X-ray diffraction to assess crystallographic structure, Raman spectroscopy to probe vibrational modes and electronic interactions, and scanning electron microscopy to examine surface morphology and microstructural features. The study reveals critical insights into the interfacial phenomena and property enhancements arising from the integration of these materials, highlighting their potential for applications in next-generation electronic, photonic, and energy technologies.},
