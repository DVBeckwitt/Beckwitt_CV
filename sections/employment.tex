    \entry*[2021 -- Present]%
    \textbf{Graduate Researcher,} University of Missouri; Advisor: Dr. Paul Miceli
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed a Python framework for quantitative modeling of area-detector GIWAXS measurements, implementing Reverse Monte Carlo methods to extract occupancies, anisotropic Debye--Waller factors, mosaicity, dimensionality, and laboratory geometry.
        \item Extended simulation tools to model diffuse intensities from stacking-fault distributions, enabling quantitative determination of fault densities.
        \item Grew phase-controlled PbI$_2$ thin films via CVD; validated simulations against experimental polytype fractions.
        \item Implemented convolutional neural networks trained on simulated GIWAXS images for automated, quantitative structural characterization of van der Waals thin-films.
    \end{itemize}

    \entry*[2019 -- 2020]%
        \textbf{Research Intern,} NASA Space Consortium
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Synthesized graphene thin films using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD); characterized structural quality via Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy.
        \end{itemize}

    \entry*[2017 -- 2020]%
        \textbf{Research Assistant,} Missouri State University; Advisors: Dr. Kartik Ghosh \& Dr. Saibal Mitra
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed, built, and operated a PLD system; characterized films via XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM/EDS, and force-sensitive profilometry.
        \end{itemize}


    \entry*[2019]%
        \textbf{Research \& Development Intern,} Dynatek Labs
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Developed software for biomedical testing and automated hardware systems.
        \end{itemize}
